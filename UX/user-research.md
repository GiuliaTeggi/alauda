In a few bullet points- by building this app, what are you looking to prove?

- The more attached people are to their mobile devices, the more opportunities mobile technology presents for helping to structure users' days in an efficient and productive way
- The involvement of technology in people's lives can decrease rather than increasing levels of stress
- PWA presents opportunities for producing simple apps without knowing underlying native technologies
