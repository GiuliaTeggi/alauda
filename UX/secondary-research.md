Morning anxiety is surprisingly common. It has no clinical definition, but most people define it as anxiety either immediately after waking up or anxiety that tends to build over the first hour or so upon awakening.
The reality is that most cases of morning anxiety occur because your mind and body are afraid of the stresses of the day, or the anxiety that you experience throughout the day.
The more positive you are, the more you’re going to feel better about each day, and the more you feel better about each day, the more likely you’ll experience less morning anxiety.

Examine Your Morning Stressors
There may be parts of your morning routine that are anxiety-provoking, like an alarm clock that jolts you awake. Perhaps, changing your alarm clock to one that wakes you with soothing music would be better.
In addition, your anxiety in the morning may be worsened by all the tasks you need to complete. By giving yourself plenty of time in the morning and completing some of your tasks the evening before, like packing lunches or preparing clothes, you can ease some of your anxiety.
USEFUL INNOVATIONS
Try to find recent innovations in your particular area. They could be technological, behavioral, or cultural. Understanding the edge of what’s possible will help you ask great questions.

Morning Routines Are Situational
What works for you won’t work for someone else. Some factors do include your chronotype, but they also might include what kinds of external constraints will affect your predictable rhythm.
