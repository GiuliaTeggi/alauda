## Script

### Introduction

_Thank you for helping us today. Just so you know, we will be observing the session today and making records of your interactions with the app. My name is Ivi, I’m a developer on the application, the application we're working on requires you to complete your profile and will send you daily morning notifications consisting of soundtracks you might like as well as collections of random images you might find entertaining. As a bonus (humorous) you will also be receiving collections of sounds and images you might absolutely hate. You do not have to look at the latter._

_Today we are asking you to try the very first prototype of our application. The purpose of this session is to see whether the app is easy to navigate and its structure is fit for purpose. To reiterate: this is not a final, coded product, this is the first prototype, some of its features are not yet built._

_One thing that is really important to remember is that we are testing the application, not you! You can’t do anything wrong during today’s session. We encourage you to ‘click around.’ You should also not worry about breaking the app._

The summary of the key points describing today’s session is as follows:
Do not worry about making mistakes;
You are testing a prototype, not the App;
Please describe all your feelings and difficulties you come across whilst testing;
Tell us what you expect to happen as you are ‘clicking around’;
Ask questions and express your confusion if it occurs;
If you need a break tell us;
Do not worry about hurting our feelings; we appreciate all feedback!

Do you have any questions now?

Collecting user data (general questions)

I am now going to ask a few questions about you. Once again, we need to assess the potential audience for our app, not you. We will send you no promotional information and we will not share any information about you with any third parties.

Q1. What is your occupation? Describe your job at the moment.



Q2. Would you describe yourself as a power mobile phone user? In other words, do you use your mobile a lot?



Q3. Please, describe your morning routine in 2-3 sentences.



Q4. Do you check notifications on your phone in the morning? Describe when do you do it and how much time you spend doing it.



Q5. Name and describe some of your favourite websites and apps.




Demonstration

The tester demonstrates the home page of the app and repeats the concept. The tester invites to ask more questions.

Great, that's it for the questions, we can now open the app.


User tasks

Task 1. Imagine you came across our web sites by accident. Explore what it does and try using it. Do not forget to tell us in as much detail as possible about your experiences, expectations and difficulties you are experiencing.








Task 2. Imagine you have made up your mind about subscribing to our app. Complete your profile and submit it. Do not forget to tell us in as much detail as possible about your experiences, expectations and difficulties you are experiencing.






Task 3. Imagine you have changed your mind about subscribing to our app. Delete your user account. Do not forget to tell us in as much detail as possible about your experiences, expectations and difficulties you are experiencing.




Task 4. Imagine you have received your morning notifications. Check out what they are. Do not forget to tell us in as much detail as possible about your experiences, expectations and difficulties you are experiencing.



If the user goes quet the tester should encourage them to talk by asking the following prompting questions:

What do you think this is for?
What do you think this does?
What do you think is on the next screen?
How does what happens on this screen differ from your expectations?
What are you looking for?
What would you like to do / see next

Follow up questions:

How does the prototype compare to your expectations/prior experience with similar apps?
What did you like about the app?
What did you hate about the app?
What would you change (list 3 main things)?
How would describe this product to a friend?
